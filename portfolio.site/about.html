        <h1>Hi, I’m <span>Anusri </span></h1>
        <p>
         I’m Anusri, a passionate business analytics student, marketing enthusiast, and creative web developer with a strong focus on data-driven problem-solving. I love crafting websites that not only look great but are also optimized for performance, engagement, and user experience.
With hands-on experience in programming, data analysis, and project execution, I bring a balance of technical expertise and marketing insight—turning ideas into impactful digital solutions that help brands grow.
My key skills include:
Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Data Analysis & Programming: Excel, Python
Marketing & Strategy: Creating digital presence and engagement plans
Optimization & Problem-Solving: Applying mathematical models like linear programming
I’m deeply passionate about education technology, social impact projects, and leveraging marketing and technology to empower businesses and communities.
Let’s connect and create digital experiences that inspire growth, innovation, and real impact.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe in building sustainable and meaningful ideas that make a difference.  
          When I’m not working on projects, you’ll find me exploring <strong>new designs, photography, or traveling</strong> to learn from real-world experiences.
